Hi, Iâ€™m Shubham. I believe in Maths.  
I seek to learn and try to apply all that I learn in a way that makes life easier.  
I can design and develop technology solutions. Algorithms and Data Structures are my friends.   
C++ and Python are my weapons, at times for web solutions I mingle up with PHP.JavaScript is my another love.

I do competitive programming and equally, make open source contributions.  
Machine Learning and Data Analytics are my other areas of Interest. 

I'm looking for an Internship where I can learn and grow by using my tech skills for achieving goals of the organisation.
